# Portfolio Project
### The Problem
The problem was to build a portfolio site for myself, following the provided design as close as possible.

I started by making the components I thought I needed for the project. Tried to keep everything seperate to make it easier to slot in an out modules if I want to change things in the future. This means especially the CSS isn't as DRY as it could be, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make at this time.
